### Quant Strategies Tab (New)

The Quant Strategies tab adds a simple backtesting sandbox to quickly evaluate a classic moving-average crossover strategy.

- **Strategy**: Long entry when Short SMA crosses above Long SMA; exit when Short SMA crosses below Long SMA.
- **Inputs**:
  - **Symbol**: Defaults to the currently viewed stock or `AAPL`.
  - **Short SMA** and **Long SMA**: Choose lookback windows (e.g., 10 / 20).
- **Outputs**:
  - **Total Return**: Compounded return from the sequence of trades.
  - **Trades**: Number of closed trades.
  - **Win Rate**: % of profitable closed trades.
  - **Avg Win / Avg Loss**: Average gain/loss per winning/losing trade.
- **Suggestions**: The app runs a small grid search of SMA pairs and lists the top 5 by total return. Click a suggestion to apply those parameters instantly.

Notes and limitations:
- This is an educational tool, not investment advice.
- Uses end-of-day daily data; returns ignore transaction costs, slippage, and dividends.
- For sufficient accuracy, ensure there are enough history points relative to the chosen SMA windows.

## API Endpoints Used

The application uses the following TwelveData API endpoints:

- `/quote` - Real-time stock quotes
- `/time_series` - Historical price data
- `/profile` - Company information
- `/income_statement` - Financial statements
- `/balance_sheet` - Balance sheet data
- `/cash_flow` - Cash flow statements
- `/earnings` - Earnings data
- `/news` - Company news
- `/symbol_search` - Stock symbol search

### Fallback Data Sources

If the TwelveData demo key is used (which often only returns AAPL for real-time quotes), the app automatically tries public fallback sources for broader coverage:

- **Quotes (Fallback)**: Stooq JSON quote feed
  - `https://stooq.com/q/l/?s={symbol}.us&f=sd2t2ohlcv&h&e=json`
- **Time Series (Fallback)**: Stooq daily CSV
  - `https://stooq.com/q/d/l/?s={symbol}.us&i=d`

Returned data are normalized to match the app‚Äôs expected shape where possible.

### Missing Company Data:
Some companies might not have complete data available due to:

- Check if the company is publicly traded on major exchanges
- Verify the stock symbol is correct
- Consider upgrading to a paid API plan for more comprehensive data
 - When using the demo key, rely on the built-in Stooq fallbacks for broader symbol coverage
